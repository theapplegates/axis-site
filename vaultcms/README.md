# Vault CMS

The open-source headless content management system that turns [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) into a publishing platform for your [Astro](https://astro.build) website.

## Features 

- **Auto-detection and automation**: Detects your Astro routes and content structure automatically.
- **CMS-like homepage**: See your content in a visual grid and perform bulk actions.
- **Preconfigured**: Optimized settings, hotkeys, and plugins for the Astro workflow.
- **Headless and flexible**: Just Markdown files and a workspace ready to be customized by you.
- **Compatability**: Works with almost any Astro theme.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to install Vault CMS into your Astro project is via the CLI at your project root:

```bash
npx create-vaultcms
# or
npm create vaultcms
# or
pnpm create vaultcms
# or
yarn create vaultcms
```

*The installer detects your Astro project and defaults to `src/content` (use `.` for project root).*

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually, you can download the latest version of Vault CMS and place it directly into your Astro project.

1. **Download the source**: [Clone this repository](https://github.com/davidvkimball/vaultcms) or [download the ZIP archive](https://github.com/davidvkimball/vaultcms/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
2. **Locate your project root**: This is typically the directory containing `astro.config.mjs` and `package.json`.
3. **Move the files**: Copy the `.obsidian` and `_bases` folders (and `_GUIDE.md`) into your project—typically `src/content`, or project root if you prefer.
4. **Open in Obsidian**: Open that folder as a new vault in Obsidian.

### Presets

For themes like **Starlight**, **Slate**, or **Chiri**, run the CLI and choose a preset when prompted:

```bash
npx create-vaultcms
```

To skip the prompt and set the template in one go (e.g. for scripts), use `npx create-vaultcms --template <name>`. See all presets at the [Presets Repo](https://github.com/davidvkimball/vaultcms-presets).

### AI agents (MCP)
