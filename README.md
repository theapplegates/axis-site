## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Run these commands from this project root, the folder that contains `astro.config.mjs`.
Open `src/content` as the vault in Obsidian. The nested `vaultcms/` folder is the
Vault CMS installer package source; you only need to work there if you are changing
the installer itself.

## Updating

Axis ships with an updater that pulls the latest release, swaps in the new framework files, and leaves your content alone.

```bash
pnpm run update
```

**First run** — you'll be prompted for your Axis license key (from your purchase receipt). It's saved to `.env` as `AXIS_LICENSE_KEY` for future runs. The `.env` file is gitignored.

**What gets preserved:**

- `src/content/` — all your posts, pages, projects, docs, and the entire `.obsidian/` vault
- `public/assets/` and user-uploaded files in `public/`
- `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`
- Favicons (`public/favicon.png`, `favicon-dark.png`, `favicon-light.png`)

**What gets replaced:** everything else (framework code, layouts, components, scripts, configs, `package.json`, etc.).

**After updating:**

1. Open your vault in Obsidian
2. Go to Axis Settings
3. Click "Apply all settings" — this rewrites the new `config.ts` with your saved settings
4. Run `pnpm dev` to verify

If your license key ever changes, delete the `AXIS_LICENSE_KEY` line from `.env` and run `pnpm run update` again to be re-prompted.

## Configuration

Edit `src/config.ts` to customize:

- Site metadata (title, description, author, social links)
- Default theme and available themes
- Feature toggles (dark mode, reading time, TOC, linked mentions, etc.)
- Content types (projects, docs)
- Giscus comments
- Homepage layout
- Deployment target
